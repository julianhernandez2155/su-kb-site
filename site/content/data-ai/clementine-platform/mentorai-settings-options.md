## **🛡️ Safety**

The **Safety tab** allows you to set moderation and safety rules for your mentorAI. These settings make sure that all conversations stay appropriate, inclusive, and aligned with Syracuse Universitys standards for respectful communication.

![mentorai safety panel showing moderation and safety prompts with example responses for research and innovation mentor](./attachments/567279621/Screenshot 2025-11-10 at 1.04.19 PM.png)

#### ⚖️ Moderation  Safety Settings

Each safety feature works together to filter, flag, and respond to inappropriate or sensitive interactions:

> [!note]- Moderation Prompt  Reponse
> - **Moderation Prompt:**
>   Describes what types of *user messages* should be flagged  such as hate speech, discrimination, or personal attacks.
> - **Moderation Response:**
>   The message shown to users if their input violates guidelines. It reminds them to stay respectful and may include campus contact info (e.g., *Barnes Center at 315-443-8000* for confidential support).

> [!note]- Safety Prompt  Reponse
> - **Safety Prompt:**
>   Outlines what types of *AI responses* should be restricted  for example, messages that provide medical, legal, or financial advice.
> - **Safety Response:**
>   The message displayed when the AI blocks an unsafe or off-topic question, encouraging users to seek help from appropriate campus resources instead.

> [!info]
> **💡 Tip:**Keep both prompts and responses professional, concise, and student-focused. Together, they create a balanced safety system  filtering inappropriate messages while redirecting students to the right campus support when needed.

| **Google Drive / OneDrive / Dropbox** | Connects directly to stored files in the cloud for continuous access. | Access permissions must allow mentorAI to view the file. |
| **URL / Web Crawler** | Uses website content to gather updated information or academic resources. | Must be a text-based site (not image-heavy or behind a login). |
| **YouTube / Video / Audio** | Uses transcripts or captions to extract educational or research-related information. | Requires transcript or subtitles to tokenize. |
| **GitHub** | Useful for research or coding-related projects where the mentor references repositories. | Reads text-based files only (like `.py`, `.md`, or `.txt`). |
| **Image / ZIP** | Reads any text metadata or OCR-extracted text (if available). | Cannot analyze the visual content itself. |
| **Web Crawlers** | Scans linked pages within a provided URL to gather additional related content. | Only captures textual updates, not images or media. |

| **Who Can Chat** | Limit who can actively interact: **Anyone** or **Authenticated Users** (those signed in). | Useful if your site requires SU NetID or another login. |
| **Website URL** | The web address where the mentor will be embedded. | Used for generating a unique embed token tied to that domain. |
| **Get Token** | Generates an authentication token that allows the chat to run securely on that URL. | Likely required for linking the embed to an official SU page. |
| **Context Aware** | Enables the mentor to use the website context (like the page topic) when answering. | Good for mentors hosted on resource pages or help sites. |
| **Single Sign-On (SSO)** | Integrates with campus authentication so users dont need to log in separately. | May be used by the IT department. |

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

> [!note]- Can MentorAI access or remember personal information from users?
> No. mentorAI does not automatically store personal data. Any saved memory must be manually added under the **Memory** tab by an administrator or creator/owner of a mentor.

> [!note]- Why isnt my dataset working or showing up in responses?
> mentorAI can only process text-based content. If your file or link mostly contains images or lacks visible text (like a scanned PDF), it wont be tokenized properly.

> [!note]- What does token count mean in the Datasets section?
> Tokens represent chunks of readable text that the AI has processed. More tokens generally mean more data for the mentor to reference.

> [!note]- Whats the difference between Web Search and Trained Documents?
> *Trained Documents* come from your uploaded datasets, while *Web Search* lets the mentor pull current information from the internet when responding.
